FUNCTION_DEF=func getSysInfo(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
Based on the provided function and context, here are several test scenarios for the `getSysInfo` function:

```
Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of System Information

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the getSysInfo function correctly retrieves and returns system information in JSON format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request and response writer.
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with the mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Verify that the response writer contains a valid JSON representation of the systemInfo struct.
Validation:
  The test should use json.Unmarshal to parse the response and compare each field of the resulting systemInfo struct with expected values. This ensures that all system information is correctly retrieved and formatted.
  This test is crucial as it validates the core functionality of the system monitor, ensuring it accurately reports system metrics.

Scenario 2: Handling of Memory Information Retrieval Failure

Details:
  Description: This test checks how getSysInfo handles a situation where memory information cannot be retrieved.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getMemInfo function to return error values (e.g., 0 for memory values and a high percentage).
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Verify that the response contains the error values for memory-related fields.
Validation:
  The test should check that even with partial information failure, the function still returns a valid JSON response with available data. This tests the robustness of the function in handling partial system information retrieval failures.

Scenario 3: Handling of Host Information Retrieval Failure

Details:
  Description: This test examines getSysInfo's behavior when host information retrieval fails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getHostInfo function to return empty strings for hostname, architecture, and OS.
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Verify that the response contains empty strings for host-related fields.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function gracefully handles failures in retrieving host information and still returns a valid JSON response. It's important for testing the function's resilience to partial system information failures.

Scenario 4: Handling of CPU Information Retrieval Failure

Details:
  Description: This test checks getSysInfo's response when CPU information cannot be retrieved.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the getCpuInfo function to return 0 for CPU cores and 0.0 for CPU percentage.
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Verify that the response contains the error values for CPU-related fields.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle failures in CPU information retrieval while still providing a complete response. It's crucial for ensuring the monitor can report partial system information when full data is unavailable.

Scenario 5: Correct HTTP Headers in Response

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the getSysInfo function sets the correct HTTP headers in the response.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a mock HTTP request and response writer.
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with the mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Check that the response contains the "Content-Type: application/json" header.
Validation:
  Ensuring correct headers is crucial for proper interpretation of the response by clients. This test validates that the function adheres to HTTP standards for JSON responses.

Scenario 6: Large Values Handling

Details:
  Description: This test checks how getSysInfo handles and represents very large system values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock system information functions to return very large values (e.g., extremely high memory or CPU core count).
  Act: Call the getSysInfo function with mock request and response writer.
  Assert: Verify that the JSON response correctly represents these large values without loss of precision.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and accurately report extreme system configurations, which is important for scalability and accuracy across diverse hardware.

Scenario 7: Concurrent Request Handling

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that getSysInfo can handle multiple concurrent requests without data races or inconsistencies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up multiple mock requests and response writers.
  Act: Concurrently call getSysInfo multiple times with different mock requests.
  Assert: Verify that all responses are valid and consistent.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for ensuring the function's thread-safety and ability to handle high load scenarios, which is important for a system monitoring tool that might be queried frequently.
```

These scenarios cover a range of normal operations, edge cases, and potential error conditions for the `getSysInfo` function, providing a comprehensive test suite for validating its behavior and robustness.
