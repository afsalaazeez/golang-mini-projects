FUNCTION_DEF=func organizeFolder(targetFolder string) 
Scenario 1: Testing the organization of files into respective folders

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function organizeFolder correctly organizes files into their respective folders based on their extensions. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock folder with files of different extensions such as .png, .jpg, .mp4, .pdf, .mp3 and others.
  Act: Invoke the organizeFolder function with the path of the mock folder.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the files have been moved to their respective folders.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the files have been moved to their respective folders. This is important as it verifies the main functionality of the organizeFolder function.

Scenario 2: Testing the function with an empty folder

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles an empty folder.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty mock folder.
  Act: Invoke the organizeFolder function with the path of the empty folder.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function does not throw any errors and the output is "No files moved".
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function handles empty folders gracefully. This is important as it verifies the robustness of the function.

Scenario 3: Testing the function with a non-existing folder

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles a non-existing folder.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a path of a non-existing folder.
  Act: Invoke the organizeFolder function with the path of the non-existing folder.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function throws an error.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function throws an error when a non-existing folder is passed. This is important as it verifies the function's error handling capability.

Scenario 4: Testing the function with files having unknown extensions

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles files with unknown extensions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock folder with files having unknown extensions.
  Act: Invoke the organizeFolder function with the path of the mock folder.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the files with unknown extensions have been moved to the "Others" folder.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly moves files with unknown extensions to the "Others" folder. This is important as it verifies the function's capability to handle files with unknown extensions.

Scenario 5: Testing the function with files without any extensions

Details:
  Description: This test checks how the function handles files without any extensions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock folder with files without any extensions.
  Act: Invoke the organizeFolder function with the path of the mock folder.
  Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the files without any extensions have been moved to the "Others" folder.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the function correctly moves files without any extensions to the "Others" folder. This is important as it verifies the function's capability to handle files without any extensions.
