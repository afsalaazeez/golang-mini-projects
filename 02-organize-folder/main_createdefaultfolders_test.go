FUNCTION_DEF=func createDefaultFolders(targetFolder string) 
Scenario 1: Successful Folder Creation

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully create the default folders in the specified target folder when no such folder exists initially.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary directory to serve as the target folder. No folders should exist in the target directory at the start of the test.
  Act: Invoke the createDefaultFolders function with the path to the temporary directory.
  Assert: Check if the default folders ("Music", "Videos", "Docs", "Images", "Others") have been created in the target directory.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the folders have been created in the target directory, which is the expected behavior of the function. This test is important because it checks the basic functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Folder Already Exists

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the function does not create a folder if it already exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary directory and manually create one of the default folders in it.
  Act: Invoke the createDefaultFolders function with the path to the temporary directory.
  Assert: Check that no additional folder with the same name has been created.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that no duplicate folder is created, which is the behavior expected from the function. This test is important because it ensures that the function behaves correctly in the presence of existing folders.

Scenario 3: Invalid Target Directory

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check that the function handles the case when the target directory is invalid or inaccessible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Use an invalid path as the target directory.
  Act: Invoke the createDefaultFolders function with the invalid path.
  Assert: Check that an error occurs.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that an error is thrown when the function is invoked with an invalid path, which is the expected behavior. This test is important because it ensures that the function handles error conditions correctly. 

Scenario 4: Permission Denied

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check how the function handles scenarios where it does not have permission to create folders in the target directory.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a temporary directory and change its permissions to deny write access.
  Act: Invoke the createDefaultFolders function with the path to the temporary directory.
  Assert: Check that an error occurs.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that an error is thrown when the function does not have permission to create folders, which is the expected behavior. This test is important because it checks the function's behavior in situations where it does not have the necessary permissions.
