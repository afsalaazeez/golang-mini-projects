FUNCTION_DEF=func checkForReminderInterval(webStatusSlice *[]webStatus, web string) bool 
Scenario 1: Website status is down and the reminder interval has passed

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks whether the function correctly identifies when a website is down and the reminder interval has passed. The function should return true in this case, indicating that a new alert needs to be triggered.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus structs, where one of the websites is marked as down and its lastFailure field is set to a time more than the reminder interval ago.
  Act: Call the checkForReminderInterval function with the webStatus slice and the web string of the down website.
  Assert: Check that the function returns true.
Validation:
  The function should return true in this scenario, indicating that a new alert needs to be triggered because the website is still down and the reminder interval has passed. This test scenario is important to ensure that the application correctly sends reminders when websites are down for extended periods.

Scenario 2: Website status is down but the reminder interval has not passed

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks whether the function correctly identifies when a website is down but the reminder interval has not passed. The function should return false in this case, indicating that a new alert should not be triggered yet.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus structs, where one of the websites is marked as down and its lastFailure field is set to a time less than the reminder interval ago.
  Act: Call the checkForReminderInterval function with the webStatus slice and the web string of the down website.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false in this scenario, indicating that a new alert should not be triggered yet because the reminder interval has not passed. This test scenario is important to ensure that the application does not send reminders too frequently when a website is down.

Scenario 3: Website status is not down

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks whether the function correctly handles the case where a website is not down. The function should return false in this case, regardless of the lastFailure time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus structs, where one of the websites is marked as not down.
  Act: Call the checkForReminderInterval function with the webStatus slice and the web string of the not down website.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false in this scenario, indicating that no alert needs to be triggered. This test scenario is important to ensure that the application does not send alerts for websites that are not down.

Scenario 4: The provided web string does not match any websites in the webStatus slice

Details:
  Description: This test scenario checks whether the function correctly handles the case where the provided web string does not match any websites in the webStatus slice. The function should return false in this case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus structs, and a web string that does not match any of the websites in the slice.
  Act: Call the checkForReminderInterval function with the webStatus slice and the unmatched web string.
  Assert: Check that the function returns false.
Validation:
  The function should return false in this scenario, indicating that the provided web string does not correspond to any known website. This test scenario is important to ensure that the function handles invalid input gracefully.
