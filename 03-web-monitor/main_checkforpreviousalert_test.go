FUNCTION_DEF=func checkForPreviousAlert(webStatusSlice *[]webStatus, web string) bool 
Scenario 1: Check for a website that has a previous alert

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly identifies a website that has had a previous alert. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus that includes the website to check.
    Act: Invoke the function with the slice and the website as arguments.
    Assert: Check that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a website that has had a previous alert. This is important in order to avoid sending repeated alerts for the same website.

Scenario 2: Check for a website that does not have a previous alert

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the function correctly identifies a website that has not had a previous alert. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of webStatus that does not include the website to check.
    Act: Invoke the function with the slice and the website as arguments.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies a website that has not had a previous alert. This is important in order to ensure that alerts are sent when a new website goes down.

Scenario 3: Check for a website in an empty webStatus slice

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when the slice of webStatus is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty slice of webStatus.
    Act: Invoke the function with the empty slice and a website as arguments.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function handles an empty webStatus slice correctly. This is important because it is a possible edge case that could occur in the application.

Scenario 4: Check for a website with a nil webStatus slice

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check how the function behaves when the webStatus slice is nil.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a nil slice of webStatus.
    Act: Invoke the function with the nil slice and a website as arguments.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks that the function handles a nil webStatus slice correctly. This is important because it is a possible edge case that could occur in the application, and handling it correctly prevents potential crashes.
