FUNCTION_DEF=func alertUser(web string, err error, webStatusSlice *[]webStatus) 
Scenario 1: Alert User When Website is Down and Not in Alert List

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function properly adds a website to the alert list and sends an email when the website is down and not already in the alert list.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of webStatus with a website that is up and another slice with no websites.
    Act: Invoke the alertUser function with the web that is down and the slice with no websites.
    Assert: Check if the function has added the website to the alert list and triggered an email.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the website is added to the alert list and an email is triggered. This is important for the application's behavior since it alerts the user when a website goes down.

Scenario 2: Alert User When Website is Down and Already in Alert List but Reminder Interval has Passed

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function sends another email when the website is down, already in the alert list, and the reminder interval has passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of webStatus with a website that is down and the last failure time is more than the reminder interval.
    Act: Invoke the alertUser function with the web that is down and the slice with the website.
    Assert: Check if the function has triggered another email.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if another email is triggered. This is important for the application's behavior since it should alert the user again when the reminder interval has passed.

Scenario 3: Do Not Alert User When Website is Down, Already in Alert List, and Reminder Interval has not Passed

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function does not send another email when the website is down, already in the alert list, and the reminder interval has not passed.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of webStatus with a website that is down and the last failure time is less than the reminder interval.
    Act: Invoke the alertUser function with the web that is down and the slice with the website.
    Assert: Check if the function has not triggered another email.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if another email is not triggered. This is important for the application's behavior since it should not alert the user again until the reminder interval has passed.

Scenario 4: Error Handling When Website is not Valid

Details:
    Description: This test checks if the function handles errors properly when the website is not valid.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a slice of webStatus with no websites.
    Act: Invoke the alertUser function with an invalid web and the slice with no websites.
    Assert: Check if the function has handled the error properly.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the error is properly handled. This is important for the application's behavior since it should be able to handle unexpected inputs and errors.
