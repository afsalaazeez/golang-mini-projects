FUNCTION_DEF=func handleGetBooks(getCmd *flag.FlagSet, all *bool, id *string)
Scenario 1: Test handleGetBooks with all flag set to true

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly gets all books when the all flag is set to true.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the all flag to true, and initialize a mock function for getBooks to return a predefined list of books.
Act: Invoke handleGetBooks with the all flag set to true.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the printed output matches the details of all the books returned by the mock getBooks function.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly fetches and prints all books when the all flag is set to true. This is important as the function should be able to fetch all books when requested.

Scenario 2: Test handleGetBooks with id flag set to a valid id

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly gets a book with a given id, when the id flag is set to a valid id.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the id flag to a valid id, and initialize a mock function for getBooks to return a predefined list of books.
Act: Invoke handleGetBooks with the id flag set to a valid id.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the printed output matches the details of the book with the given id returned by the mock getBooks function.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly fetches and prints a book with a given id. This is important as the function should be able to fetch a book with a given id when requested.

Scenario 3: Test handleGetBooks with id flag set to an invalid id

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the case where the id flag is set to an invalid id.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the id flag to an invalid id, and initialize a mock function for getBooks to return a predefined list of books.
Act: Invoke handleGetBooks with the id flag set to an invalid id.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the printed output states that the book was not found, and that the function exits with a status code of 1.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the case where no book is found with the given id. This is important as the function should handle error cases gracefully, and inform the user when a book with the given id is not found.

Scenario 4: Test handleGetBooks with neither all nor id flags set

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles the case where neither the all flag nor the id flag is set.
Execution:
Arrange: Set both the all and id flags to false and "", respectively.
Act: Invoke handleGetBooks with neither the all flag nor the id flag set.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the printed output states that either the all flag or the id flag is needed, and that the function exits with a status code of 1.
Validation:
The assertion checks if the function correctly handles the case where neither the all flag nor the id flag is set. This is important as the function should inform the user to set either the all flag or the id flag, and exit with a status code of 1 in such cases.
