FUNCTION_DEF=func handleAddBook(addCmd *flag.FlagSet, id, title, author, price, image_url *string, addNewBook bool)
Scenario 1: Test when all arguments are provided and addNewBook is true

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully add a new book when all the necessary arguments are provided and the addNewBook flag is set to true.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a flag.FlagSet with all the necessary arguments. Also, prepare a mock for the getBooks and saveBooks function to simulate a successful addition of a new book.
    Act: Invoke the handleAddBook function with the prepared flag.FlagSet and addNewBook flag set to true.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the saveBooks function was called with the correct arguments.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking if the new book was added to the books list. If the function works correctly, the new book should be appended to the list, and the saveBooks function should be called with this updated list. This test is important to ensure that the function can successfully add a new book.

Scenario 2: Test when all arguments are provided and addNewBook is false

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully update an existing book when all the necessary arguments are provided and the addNewBook flag is set to false.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a flag.FlagSet with all the necessary arguments. Also, prepare a mock for the getBooks and saveBooks function to simulate a successful update of an existing book.
    Act: Invoke the handleAddBook function with the prepared flag.FlagSet and addNewBook flag set to false.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the saveBooks function was called with the correct arguments.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking if the existing book was updated in the books list. If the function works correctly, the book with the given id should be replaced with the new book in the list, and the saveBooks function should be called with this updated list. This test is important to ensure that the function can successfully update an existing book.

Scenario 3: Test when not all arguments are provided

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle the situation when not all the necessary arguments are provided.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a flag.FlagSet with some of the arguments missing.
    Act: Invoke the handleAddBook function with the prepared flag.FlagSet.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the function prints the correct error message and exits with the correct status code.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking if the function can handle the error situation correctly. If the function works correctly, it should print an error message and exit with status code 1. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle errors correctly.

Scenario 4: Test when the book to be updated is not found

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can handle the situation when the book to be updated is not found in the books list.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a flag.FlagSet with all the necessary arguments. Also, prepare a mock for the getBooks function to simulate a situation where the book to be updated is not found.
    Act: Invoke the handleAddBook function with the prepared flag.FlagSet and addNewBook flag set to false.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify if the function prints the correct error message and exits with the correct status code.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking if the function can handle the error situation correctly. If the function works correctly, it should print an error message and exit with status code 1. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle errors correctly.
