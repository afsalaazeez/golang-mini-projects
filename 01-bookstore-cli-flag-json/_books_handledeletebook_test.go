FUNCTION_DEF=func handleDeleteBook(deleteCmd *flag.FlagSet, id *string)
Scenario 1: Test when a valid ID is provided and the book exists in the list
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when a valid book ID is provided and the book exists in the list. The target scenario is to delete the book from the list and save the updated list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock of getBooks function to return a list of books, and a mock of saveBooks function to simulate saving books. Also, create a deleteCmd and id with valid values.
    Act: Invoke the handleDeleteBook function with the deleteCmd and id.
    Assert: Verify that the book with the provided id was deleted from the list and saveBooks function was called with the updated list.
  Validation:
    The assertion will check if the book was deleted and the updated list was saved. This is important as this is the core functionality of the function.

Scenario 2: Test when the provided ID does not exist in the book list
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when a valid book ID is provided but the book does not exist in the list. The target scenario is to display an error message and exit the function.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock of getBooks function to return a list of books, and a mock of saveBooks function to simulate saving books. Also, create a deleteCmd and id with valid values but the id does not exist in the book list.
    Act: Invoke the handleDeleteBook function with the deleteCmd and id.
    Assert: Verify that an error message is displayed and the function is exited without saving the book list.
  Validation:
    The assertion will check if an error message is displayed and the function is exited. This is important as this is the expected behavior when a book with the provided id does not exist.

Scenario 3: Test when the provided ID is empty
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when an empty ID is provided. The target scenario is to display an error message and the default command usage, and exit the function.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock of getBooks function to return a list of books, and a mock of saveBooks function to simulate saving books. Also, create a deleteCmd and an empty id.
    Act: Invoke the handleDeleteBook function with the deleteCmd and id.
    Assert: Verify that an error message and the default command usage are displayed and the function is exited without getting or saving the book list.
  Validation:
    The assertion will check if an error message and the default command usage are displayed and the function is exited. This is important as this is the expected behavior when an empty id is provided.

Scenario 4: Test when an error occurs while saving the book list
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the function when an error occurs while saving the book list. The target scenario is to handle the error properly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock of getBooks function to return a list of books, and a mock of saveBooks function to return an error. Also, create a deleteCmd and id with valid values.
    Act: Invoke the handleDeleteBook function with the deleteCmd and id.
    Assert: Verify that the error is checked and handled properly.
  Validation:
    The assertion will check if the error is handled properly. This is important as this is the expected behavior when an error occurs while saving the book list.
