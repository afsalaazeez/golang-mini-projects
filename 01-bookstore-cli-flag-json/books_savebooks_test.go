FUNCTION_DEF=func saveBooks(books []Book) error 
```
Scenario 1: Successful saving of books to a JSON file

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the saveBooks function can successfully convert a slice of books into a JSON file.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of books with valid data.
    Act: Invoke the saveBooks function with the created slice of books.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if a file named "books.json" exists and if it contains the correct JSON representation of the books.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the file was created and if the data was correctly saved. This test is important to ensure that the function can successfully save a list of books to a JSON file.

Scenario 2: Error when saving books to a JSON file

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the saveBooks function returns an error when it fails to save the books to a file.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of books with valid data and set up the environment so that the file cannot be created (e.g. insufficient permissions).
    Act: Invoke the saveBooks function with the created slice of books.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if an error is returned when the function fails to create the file. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles errors when saving the books to a file.

Scenario 3: No books to save

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the saveBooks function can handle an empty slice of books.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty slice of books.
    Act: Invoke the saveBooks function with the empty slice of books.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if a file named "books.json" exists and if it is empty.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function can handle an empty slice and if it creates an empty file. This test is important to ensure that the function can handle edge cases where there are no books to save.
    
Scenario 4: Error when marshalling books into JSON

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the saveBooks function returns an error when it fails to marshal the books into JSON.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a slice of books with invalid data that cannot be marshalled into JSON.
    Act: Invoke the saveBooks function with the created slice of books.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to check if the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if an error is returned when the function fails to marshal the books into JSON. This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles errors when marshalling the books.
